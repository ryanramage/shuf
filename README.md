### split into two files, with second limited to 15 lines.

Less random, as more preference is given to earlier lines

    速[~]$ cat ~/Downloads/log2.txt  | shuf  a.out b.out --n=15

### split into n files, with equal probablity of going to each file

    速[~]$ cat ~/Downloads/log2.txt  | shuf  a.out b.out c.out
